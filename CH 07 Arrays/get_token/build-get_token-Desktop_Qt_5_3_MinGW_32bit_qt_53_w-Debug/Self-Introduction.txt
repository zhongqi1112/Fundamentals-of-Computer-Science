Self-Introduction
Hello, everyone. I have honor to add this class and introduce myself to you. My name is Zhongqi Wang, you can call me Stephen, I come from China and I have been living in the Unite States for a year. My major is Economics, so I am taking Econ 1A, ESL 33A and Math 5B in this semester. Even though I don¡¯t decide what kind of jobs in the future, I just want to transfer as soon as possible. My dream university is University of California Berkeley, and I want to finish my courses at PCC in two years. Nowadays, I am the volunteer chairman of Global Club; there are many volunteers in the club. Volunteers will go to the Field Elementary School to help Chinese teachers to teach Chinese for native children. I think doing volunteer is very helpful; you don¡¯t only practice your speaking but also learn how to be a teacher for children. It is really a great chance and wisely choice to do volunteer. If you are interested in doing that, you can connect me by email, pccglobalvp@gmail.com. I like travelling very much. I have already been to Las Vegas, San Diego, even though Death Valley, they are nearby Los Angeles. However, I have never been to San Francisco, I heard the view is very beautiful. I¡¯d like to go there next long weekend perhaps if I have free time. Whoever have any ideas about travelling, you can connect me, we can travel together if you want, because I prefer to travelling rather than staying at home. I like to make friends come from different countries, and we can learn different cultures from each other. To improve my English, I am looking forward to talking with everyone in English. Actually, I have a good idea about learning English; I want to run a study group. We can learn English together, like speaking, grammar, vocabulary and so on. You will learn whatever you want to learn, because different person is good at different skill. If anyone wants to join us, connect me by my private email, zhongqi1112@qq.com.
