      <h1>Game of Life</h1>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
      <p>The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project is to create a simulation of John Conway's Game of Life using two-dimensional arrays. Each element of the array represents a cell that is either alive or dead. Once an initial state is set up, the program will generate a new generations based on the following Rules of the Game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A live cell with two or three live neighbors will remain alive.</li>
        <li>A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors will die.</li>
        <li>A live cell with more than three live neighbors will die.</li>
        <li>A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors will become a live cell.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The "neighbors" of s cell are the adjacent and diagonal cells.</p>
