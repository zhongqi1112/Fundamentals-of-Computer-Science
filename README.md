# Fundamentals of Computer Science

Welcome to Fundamentals of Computer Sicence course. I will share fundamental knowledge of computer science.

## Description

Introduction to the science of computers, algorithms, computer organization, flowchart design, computing systems, programming concepts, data structures, nonnumerical applications, introductory numerical methods For Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mathematics, and Science majors but open to all qualified students.

**Textbook**: [Problem Solving in C++ by Walter Savitch](./ProblemSolvingwithC++.pdf)

## Learning Outcomes
1. Demonstrate the top-down design of a computer program to solve a problem of moderately difficult problem.
2. Determine which primitive data structure is best suited to solving a moderately difficult problem.
3. Implement a computer program, which solves a moderately difficult problem utilizing the most efficient methods of flow control available.
4. Describe how a given data type is stored within a computer's memory.

## Content
The concepts discussed in this course will all be taught through the C++ programming language. There will be regular programming assignments which will include the following topics:
  - Data types and operators
  - Control structures; loops
  - Procedural abstraction, Functions
  - Arrays
  - File Input/Output
  
## Upon completion of the course you should be able to
  - Understand the difference between ‘while’, ‘do-while’, and ‘for’ loops, and when each type is best suited for solving a problem
  - Understand the difference between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value variables, and when each type is best suited
  - Save data to files and extract data from files
  - Understand how to use arrays
  - Write programs using a top-down design
  - Debug programs


#### The most important skill that students must develop in this course is the ability to effectively use top-down design and procedural abstraction.


**Top-down design**: The ‘main’ function should have very minimal amount of code. If a computation is needed to be performed, it should be done in a function. Within functions, the number of lines necessary to complete a computation should typically not exceed 20 lines of code. If the computation performed within a function is too long, it needs to be broken down further to smaller functions. The results will be a program in which large computations are broken down into smaller ones.


**Procedural Abstraction**: The purpose of a function should be specific to a task and reusable for multiple programs which require a similar computation. A function should not make any reference to the details of the program/problem at hand. It should perform a necessary task, independent of what is going on in the rest of the program.
